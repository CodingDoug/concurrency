# Android Concurrency samples from AnDevCon

This is a companion sample app from my talk at [AnDevCon](http://www.andevcon.com/) titled
"Battle-Tested Patterns in Android Concurrency".  It demonstrates some good and some not-so-good
ways to make use of the threading and concurrency facilities in Android.

You should be able to import the project into Android Studio and build it with the gradle
wrapper on the command line.
